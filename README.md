A high-performance, **100% client-side** tool for removing watermarks from images generated by Google Gemini AI. Built with pure Vanilla JavaScript, it uses a mathematically precise **Reverse Alpha Blending** algorithm to restore pixels with zero quality loss.

## 🚀 Features

* **100% Client-Side Processing:** No servers involved. Images are processed locally in your browser for maximum privacy.
* **Lossless Restoration:** Uses exact mathematical inversion rather than AI inpainting, ensuring original pixel quality is preserved.
* **Zero Dependencies:** Built with native ES6 Modules and Tailwind CSS (via CDN) — no complex build steps required.
* **Auto-Detection:** Automatically detects watermark size (48px or 96px) based on image resolution.
* **Mobile Responsive:** Fully optimized UI for desktop and mobile devices.

## 🧠 How It Works (The Algorithm)

Gemini adds watermarks using a standard **Alpha Compositing** (blending) technique. This tool simply reverses that math.

### 1. The Watermark Formula
When Gemini generates an image, it applies the watermark logo using this formula:

$$Pixel_{final} = (\alpha \times Pixel_{logo}) + (1 - \alpha) \times Pixel_{original}$$

Where:
* `α` (Alpha): The transparency level of the watermark pixel (0.0 to 1.0).
* `Pixel_logo`: The color of the watermark (Pure White / 255).
* `Pixel_original`: The original color we want to recover.

### 2. The Solution (Reverse Engineering)
Since we know the `Pixel_final` (from your uploaded image), the `Pixel_logo` (White), and the `α` map (extracted from reference images), we can solve for `Pixel_original`:

$$Pixel_{original} = \frac{Pixel_{final} - (\alpha \times Pixel_{logo})}{1 - \alpha}$$

### 3. Alpha Map Extraction
The tool loads two reference "background" images (`bg_48.png` and `bg_96.png`) which contain the isolated watermark alpha values. It reads these values to construct a precise `Float32Array` map of transparency levels, allowing for pixel-perfect subtraction.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic markup.
* **CSS:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (loaded via CDN for simplicity).
* **JavaScript:** Vanilla ES6+ (No frameworks like React or Vue).
* **Libraries:**
    * [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) (for icons).
    * (Optional) JSZip (if bulk download is implemented).

## ⚡ Running Locally

Since this project uses **ES6 Modules** (`import`/`export`), you cannot simply open `index.html` in a file explorer (CORS security rules will block the script loading). You must serve it via a local server.

### Option 1: VS Code (Recommended)
1.  Install the **"Live Server"** extension.
2.  Right-click `index.html`.
3.  Select **"Open with Live Server"**.

### Option 2: Python
If you have Python installed, open a terminal in the project folder and run:
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
```
